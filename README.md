# Settle

A bill splitting app in Unity.

On iOS I loved the [Plates app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/plates-by-splitwise/id669801762). I struggled to find the equivalent style and functionality on Android, so wrote this with Unity. You enter the bill amounts then assign items to individuals. There is no split item feature as I never found it that useful, but I added dynamic recalculation of each individual's total, so once you assign their items, they are complete (whereas in Plates, you don't get the totals until all items are assigned to all individuals).

Used Unity Editor version 2019.2.12f1. For Android install you will need the Android build tools and to put your phone into developer mode as the code/.apk is currently unsigned.
